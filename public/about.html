    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>With this website I want to show everything I have learnt so far about web developement. <br/>
      That means that I will try to include as many characteristics of HTML and CSS as possible [and not only]. <br/>
      For now, what I would like you to do is to go to the previous page and click on my image to see<br/>
      the rest of my work.</p>
